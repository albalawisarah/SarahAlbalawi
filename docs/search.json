I also had a knack for mathematics and, needless to say, the field of biostatistics intrigued me. During the dental internship program, I explored multiple specialties and disciplines of dentistry. While each carried a significant role in improving dental health, they were limited to the clinical setting and focused largely on treatment rather than prevention. Dental public health did not receive as much attention despite its imperative role in addressing root causes of oral diseases. My desire to join the preventive workforce and become a community dentist motivated me pursue the Master of Public Health degree."
